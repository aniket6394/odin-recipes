   <p>Try this authentic tandoori chicken that's marinated in yogurt and spices, then cooked on the grill instead of a clay oven so you can make it at home. Serve with long-grain basmati rice, grilled veggies, roasted corn on the cob, and a cucumber salad.</p>
   <p><strong>ingredients are</strong></p>
   <ul>
    <li>2 pounds chicken, cut into pieces</li>
    <li>1 medium lemon, juiced</li>
    <li>1 Â¼ cups plain yogurt</li>
    <li>1 clove garlic, minced</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon cayenne pepper</li>
    <li>2 teaspoons garam masala</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon grated fresh ginger root</li>
   </ul>
   <h1>steps are</h1>
   <ol>
   <li>Gather all ingredients.</li>
   <li>Remove and discard skin from chicken pieces. Cut slits into meat and place into a shallow dish. Season chicken on both sides with lemon juice and salt.</li>
   <li>Mix yogurt, onion, garlic, garam masala, ginger, and cayenne pepper together in a medium bowl until smooth, then stir in food coloring.</li>

   <li>Spread yogurt mixture over chicken, cover, and refrigerate for 6 to 24 hours (the longer the better).</li>
   <li>When ready to cook, preheat an outdoor grill for medium-high heat and lightly oil the grate. Remove chicken from marinade. Discard remaining marinade.</li>
   <li>Cook chicken on the preheated grill until no longer pink and the juices run clear. An instant-read thermometer inserted near the bone should read 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).</li>
   <li>Garnish with cilantro and lemon wedges.</li>
